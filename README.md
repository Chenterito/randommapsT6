# randommapsT6
Random maps and gamemode to T6 Plutonium

# How to implement.
Copy the file ""randommapsT6.gsc" into "Plutonium\storage\t6\scripts\mp" of your Plutonium folder.

Add or remove maps as you like in "level.poolmaps", separating them with a space.

Add or remove game modes as you like in "level.poolgamemodes", separating them with a space. Each game mode must end with ".cfg", as you see in the script.
